# *1.1.0*

Seventeenth release of RainbowCake.

## What's new

### Kotlin 1.4 update

The project is now compiled with Kotlin 1.4, the latest stable version of Kotlin ðŸŽ‰. This cleaned up a bit of the implementation, and most importantly, all library modules now have [explicit API mode](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/whatsnew14.html#explicit-api-mode-for-library-authors) enabled, ensuring that all public API is explicitly marked as public.

### Small things

- Fixed an issue with built-in logging [#16](https://github.com/rainbowcake/rainbowcake/pull/16) (Thanks to TamÃ¡s VÃ¡gÃ³!)
- Updated target and compile SDK versions to 30
- Version updates for various dependencies
