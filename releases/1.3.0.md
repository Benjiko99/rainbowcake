# *1.3.0*

Nineteenth release of RainbowCake.

## What's new

### Support for DialogFragment and BottomSheetDialogFragment

RainbowCake now ships two classes for supporting special kinds of Fragments. Using the new `RainbowCakeDialogFragment` and `RainbowCakeBottomSheetDialogFragment` (now isn't that a mouthful!) classes works very similarly to using `RainbowCakeFragment`.

Thanks to [julienherrero](https://github.com/julienherrero) for their contribution that kicked this off.

### Dependency updates

- Kotlin 1.4.20
- Android Gradle Plugin 4.1.1
